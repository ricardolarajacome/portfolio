{"cells":[{"source":"# Strategic Analysis of High-Growth Markets: Insights for Investment Firms\n\nAs part of a simulated project within my portfolio, I assumed the role of a data analyst entrusted with supporting an imaginary investment firm in dissecting trends within the high-growth sector. While this scenario isn't based on real-world data, it mirrors the challenges and objectives commonly encountered in the realm of investment analysis. Acknowledging the adage that the average annual return from stocks hovers around 10%, I embarked on the task of identifying unconventional insights to outperform this benchmark.\n\n## Objective\n\nThe objective was clear: provide actionable insights by identifying the industries producing the highest valuations and the rate at which new high-value companies, or \"unicorns,\" are emerging. Leveraging their unicorns database, I set out to uncover valuable trends that could inform the firm's portfolio strategy moving forward.\n\n## Procedure\n\nTo accomplish this, I embarked on a structured query aimed at addressing specific questions posed by the firm:\n\nIdentifying Top-Performing Industries: The first step was to pinpoint the three best-performing industries based on the combined number of new unicorns created over the years 2019, 2020, and 2021.\nExploring Unicorn Metrics: From the identified top industries, the query delved into gathering crucial metrics, including the total number of unicorns within each industry.\nTimeline of Unicorn Emergence: Additionally, the query sought to determine the year in which each unicorn within the selected industries achieved their status.\nValuation Analysis: A key aspect of the analysis involved computing the average valuation of unicorns within the selected industries, converted to billions of dollars and rounded to two decimal places.\nWith the comprehensive dataset and the insights gleaned from the query, I crafted a succinct yet informative table. This table, featuring columns for industry, year, number of unicorns, and average valuation (in billions), was meticulously sorted as per the firm's request: by year and number of unicorns, both in descending order.\n\nBy presenting this data-driven analysis, I provided the investment firm with a strategic advantage, offering clarity on industry trends and empowering them to make informed decisions in structuring their portfolio for optimal returns.\n\n## Database structure:\n\n## dates\n| Column       | Description                                  |\n|-------------
