{"cells":[{"source":"# Analyzing Content from Streaming Services Using SQL\n\nFor this project, I will process and explore content from popular streaming services such as Amazon Prime, Hulu, Netflix, and Disney+. Each service will have its own table in our database. Fortunately, the data from these platforms shares mostly the same column names, allowing us to join them using UNIONs. I've opted to use UNION ALL to preserve any potential duplicate rows, as we need to count entries that appear across multiple services. Additionally, to retain streaming service information, I've included a 'genres' table containing film titles and their respective genres.\n\nNow, let's examine the number of rows with missing data in the 'age,' 'IMDb,' and 'Rotten Tomatoes' rating fields.","metadata":{},"id":"f952c7a6-a606-412d-a4a0-1ada58e35561","cell_type":"markdown"},{"source":"WITH service_data AS (\n\tSELECT *, 'amazon' AS service\n    FROM public.amazon\n\n    UNION ALL \n\n    SELECT *, 'hulu' AS service\n    FROM hulu \n\n    UNION ALL \n\n    SELECT *, 'netflix' AS service \n    FROM netflix \n\n    UNION ALL \n\n    SELECT *, 'disney' AS service\n    FROM disney\n),\n\nall_data AS (\n\tSELECT *\n    FROM service_data AS sd\n    LEFT JOIN genres AS g\n    ON sd.title = g.film\n)\n\nSELECT \nSUM(CASE WHEN imdb IS NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS imdb_missing,\nSUM(CASE WHEN age IS NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS age_missing,\nSUM(CASE WHEN rotten_tomatoes IS NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS rt_missing\nFROM all_data;","metadata":{"customType":"sql","dataFrameVariableName":"df","initial":false,"sqlSource":{"integrationId":"f6552bd7-34dd-47fe-8dd6-900e59e469c0","integrationType":"postgresql","type":"integration"},"executionCancelledAt":null,"executionTime":802,"lastExecutedAt":1714427301874,"lastExecutedByKernel":"f22d69bd-471a-43fc-b606-331760084db8","lastScheduledRunId":null,"lastSuccessfullyExecutedCode":"WITH service_data AS (\n\tSELECT *, 'amazon' AS service\n    FROM public.amazon\n\n    UNION ALL \n\n    SELECT *, 'hulu' AS service\n    FROM hulu \n\n    UNION ALL \n\n    SELECT *, 'netflix' AS service \n    FROM netflix \n\n    UNION ALL \n\n    SELECT *, 'disney' AS service\n    FROM disney\n),\n\nall_data AS (\n\tSELECT *\n    FROM service_data AS sd\n    LEFT JOIN genres AS g\n    ON sd.title = g.film\n)\n\nSELECT \nSUM(CASE WHEN imdb IS NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS imdb_missing,\nSUM(CASE WHEN age IS NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS age_missing,\nSUM(CASE WHEN rotten_tomatoes IS NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS rt_missing\nFROM all_data","outputsMetadata":{"0":{"height":96,"type":"dataFrame"}}},"id":"202fd6cc-7c21-482d-93cf-8efe044f6434","cell_type":"code","execution_count":4,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"application/com.datacamp.data-table.v2+json":{"table":{"schema":{"fields":[{"name":"index","type":"integer"},{"name":"imdb_missing","type":"integer"},{"name":"age_missing","type":"integer"},{"name":"rt_missing","type":"integer"}],"primaryKey":["index"],"pandas_version":"1.4.0"},"data":{"index":[0],"imdb_missing":[6901],"age_missing":[3633],"rt_missing":[7]}},"total_rows":1,"truncation_type":null},"text/plain":"   imdb_missing  age_missing  rt_missing\n0          6901         3633           7","text/html":"<div>\n<style scoped>\n    .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {\n        vertical-align: middle;\n    }\n\n    .dataframe tbody tr th {\n        vertical-align: top;\n    }\n\n    .dataframe thead th {\n        text-align: right;\n    }\n</style>\n<table border=\"1\" class=\"dataframe\">\n  <thead>\n    <tr style=\"text-align: right;\">\n      <th></th>\n      <th>imdb_missing</th>\n      <th>age_missing</th>\n      <th>rt_missing</th>\n    </tr>\n  </thead>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <th>0</th>\n      <td>6901</td>\n      <td>3633</td>\n      <td>7</td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n</div>"},"metadata":{},"execution_count":4,"@datacamp/metadata":{"executedQuery":"WITH service_data AS (\n\tSELECT *, 'amazon' AS service\n    FROM public.amazon\n\n    UNION ALL \n\n    SELECT *, 'hulu' AS service\n    FROM hulu \n\n    UNION ALL \n\n    SELECT *, 'netflix' AS service \n    FROM netflix \n\n    UNION ALL \n\n    SELECT *, 'disney' AS service\n    FROM disney\n),\n\nall_data AS (\n\tSELECT *\n    FROM service_data AS sd\n    LEFT JOIN genres AS g\n    ON sd.title = g.film\n)\n\nSELECT \nSUM(CASE WHEN imdb IS NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS imdb_missing,\nSUM(CASE WHEN age IS NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS age_missing,\nSUM(CASE WHEN rotten_tomatoes IS NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS rt_missing\nFROM all_data","executedQueryParameters":[]}}]},{"source":"It appears that there is a significant amount of missing data concerning IMDb scores.
